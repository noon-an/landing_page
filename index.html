        <p>With a fleet of some of the venerated fighter jets in history, American aircraft are some of the most feared and coveted in equal measure, from the P51 mustang that dominated the European skies during the Second World War, to the A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) that preys on enemy Tanks and armored vehicles, and the fifth generation F22 Raptor and the F35 Lightening both revered for their avionics, stealth, situational awareness and above all, air superiority</p>
